        <h2> The Brown Bear</h2>
        <p>The brown bear (Ursus arctos) is a large bear species found
             across Eurasia and North America. It is one of the largest living 
             terrestrial members of the order Carnivora, rivaled in size only by
              its closest relative, the polar bear (Ursus maritimus), which is
               much less variable in size and slightly bigger on average.</p>
